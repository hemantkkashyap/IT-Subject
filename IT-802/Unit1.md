# 📘 Unit I: Introduction – Machine Learning (IT 802 A)

This unit introduces fundamental concepts of Machine Learning, various types of learning, and theoretical foundations like Hypothesis Space, PAC Learning, and VC Dimension.

---

## 🔹 1. Introduction (परिचय)

- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of AI where computers learn from **data** to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- ML helps in tasks like **pattern recognition**, **recommendations**, and **automation**.

🧠 *Example:*  
Like a student learns from past papers, a machine learns from past data (e.g., Netflix suggests shows based on what you watched before).

---

## 🔹 2. Learning Paradigms (सीखने के तरीके)

### 📌 a. Supervised Learning
- Data is labeled (input + correct output).
- Model learns to map inputs to outputs.
- ✅ *Example:* Email spam detection (spam or not spam).

### 📌 b. Unsupervised Learning
- No labeled output.
- Model finds hidden patterns or groupings.
- ✅ *Example:* Customer segmentation based on buying behavior.

### 📌 c. Reinforcement Learning
- Learning by trial and error.
- Rewards/punishments guide learning.
- ✅ *Example:* Game-playing bots, like chess or tic-tac-toe AI.

## 🔹 3. Perspectives and Issues (दृष्टिकोण और समस्याएं)

- ⚖️ **Bias vs Variance:**
  - *Bias:* Too simple model; misses patterns.
  - *Variance:* Too complex model; memorizes noise.

- 🧪 **Overfitting:** Model works great on training data but poorly on new data.

- 🧹 **Data Quality:** Noisy, missing, or incorrect data harms model performance.

- 🧮 **Computation Cost:** Big data needs fast hardware and optimized code.

---

## 🔹 4. Concept Learning (कॉन्सेप्ट लर्निंग)

- Learning a general concept from specific examples.
- Model forms rules based on features.

🧠 *Example:* Learning what is a “fruit” based on color, size, taste.

---

## 🔹 5. Version Spaces (वर्शन स्पेस)

- The set of all **hypotheses** that are consistent with training examples.
- Helps in narrowing down the best model.

🧠 *Example:* Out of 100 possible rules, only 10 match current data – those 10 form the version space.

---

## 🔹 6. Finite and Infinite Hypothesis Spaces

- **Hypothesis Space:** All possible models/rules a learner can choose from.

### a. Finite Hypothesis Space:
- Limited number of hypotheses.
- ✅ *Example:* Small decision tree with fixed depth.

### b. Infinite Hypothesis Space:
- Infinite possibilities.
- ✅ *Example:* Linear regression with real-valued weights.

---

## 🔹 7. PAC Learning (Probably Approximately Correct)

- A theoretical model for evaluating learning algorithms.

📌 It means:
- **Probably (P):** With high probability (e.g., 95%)
- **Approximately Correct (AC):** Model is close to correct (e.g., 90% accuracy)

🧠 *Example:* A spam filter that works 90% correctly, 95% of the time.

---

## 🔹 8. VC Dimension (Vapnik–Chervonenkis Dimension)

- A measure of a model’s **capacity or complexity**.
- Higher VC = More complex model = More data needed.

📌 *Shattering:* A model can classify all combinations of some data points correctly.

🧠 *Example:*  
A straight line can shatter 3 points in 2D ⇒ VC dimension = 3.
