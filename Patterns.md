## üß† Core Patterns (Most Important)

### 1. Two Pointers
- **Use**: Searching in sorted arrays, removing duplicates.
- **Think**: Use when working with sorted arrays and need to compare/scan from both ends.
- **Example**: Check if array has a pair that sums to a target.

---

### 2. Sliding Window
- **Use**: Subarray/substring problems with constraints.
- **Think**: Use when working with contiguous sequences (substrings, subarrays).
- **Example**: Longest substring without repeating characters.

---

### 3. Fast & Slow Pointers
- **Use**: Detect cycles, find midpoints.
- **Think**: Use when cycle or midpoint is involved.
- **Example**: Linked list cycle detection, happy number.

---

### 4. Merge Intervals
- **Use**: Combine overlapping intervals.
- **Think**: Use when given intervals or ranges and need to simplify or merge them.
- **Example**: Merge overlapping meetings.

---

### 5. Cyclic Sort
- **Use**: Arrays with elements from 1 to n (or 0 to n-1).
- **Think**: If numbers are within a range and need to be at correct index.
- **Example**: Find missing or duplicate numbers.

---

### 6. In-place Reversal (Linked List)
- **Use**: Reverse linked lists without extra space.
- **Think**: When asked to reverse structure efficiently.
- **Example**: Reverse entire list or part of it.

---

### 7. Tree BFS
- **Use**: Level-wise traversal in trees.
- **Think**: If question talks about levels, shortest path in trees.
- **Example**: Min depth, zig-zag level traversal.

---

### 8. Tree DFS
- **Use**: Recursively explore all nodes/paths.
- **Think**: Use when exploring full paths or computing values recursively.
- **Example**: Path sum, all root-to-leaf paths.

---

### 9. Two Heaps
- **Use**: Median in stream, top-k balancing.
- **Think**: Use for maintaining largest/smallest halves.
- **Example**: Find median from stream.

---

### 10. Subsets / Backtracking
- **Use**: All combinations, permutations, power sets.
- **Think**: Use when question says ‚Äúall possible ways‚Äù or ‚Äúcombinations‚Äù.
- **Example**: Subsets, combination sum.

---

### 11. Modified Binary Search
- **Use**: Searching in sorted but modified data.
- **Think**: Use when sorted structure with a twist (e.g., rotation).
- **Example**: Rotated sorted array.

---

### 12. Bit Manipulation (XOR Patterns)
- **Use**: Odd/even count, single occurrence.
- **Think**: If "only one different number" is mentioned.
- **Example**: Find unique number among duplicates.

---

### 13. Top K Elements (Heap)
- **Use**: Find K largest/frequent elements.
- **Think**: Use when asked to find ‚ÄúTop K‚Äù.
- **Example**: Top K frequent words, largest K elements.

---

### 14. K-way Merge
- **Use**: Merge K sorted arrays/lists.
- **Think**: Use heap/priority queue to pull smallest from K sorted sources.
- **Example**: Merge K sorted linked lists.

---

### 15. 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
- **Use**: Choose items under weight/value constraint.
- **Think**: If problem has limit and selection is involved.
- **Example**: Maximize value in bag under weight.

---

### 16. Topological Sort (Graph)
- **Use**: Order tasks with dependencies.
- **Think**: Use when task A depends on task B finishing first.
- **Example**: Course schedule, job scheduling.

---

---

## üí° Advanced / Less Common (Harder, CP-Focused)

### 17. Greedy Algorithms
- **Use**: Local best decisions lead to global optimum.
- **Think**: If you can make choices step-by-step without revisiting.
- **Example**: Activity selection, Huffman coding.

---

### 18. Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
- **Use**: Efficient range queries and updates (sum, min, max).
- **Think**: If range query + update operations are frequent.
- **Example**: Range sum, range min/max in log(n).

---

### 19. Line Sweep
- **Use**: Geometry problems or events sorted by coordinate/time.
- **Think**: When processing ‚Äúevents‚Äù in sorted order.
- **Example**: Maximum number of overlapping intervals.

---

### 20. Mo‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Use**: Offline range queries in ‚àöN time.
- **Think**: If there are many range queries on static data.
- **Example**: Number of distinct elements in range.

---

### 21. Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)
- **Use**: Advanced tree query optimization.
- **Think**: Use for tree queries like LCA or path sums efficiently.
- **Example**: Path queries in trees (used with Segment Trees).

---

### 22. Suffix Array / Trie
- **Use**: String searching, pattern matching.
- **Think**: Use for suffix-based problems or fast prefix lookups.
- **Example**: Longest repeated substring, autocomplete systems.

---

### 23. Offline Queries / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- **Use**: Grouping and dynamic connectivity.
- **Think**: If you need to track connectivity over time.
- **Example**: Dynamic graph connectivity, Kruskal's algorithm.

---

### 24. Euler Tour / LCA in Trees
- **Use**: Tree traversal for range representation and ancestor queries.
- **Think**: Use for finding common ancestors or subtree range queries.
- **Example**: LCA using binary lifting, subtree queries using Euler tour.
